# Making a Steel Tide mod: a brief for a coding agent

You are helping make a mod for Steel Tide (https://steelti.de), a browser real-time strategy game.
A mod adds units, buildings and upgrade levels. It cannot change the game's rules, its interface, or an existing unit or building: it only adds, and everything it adds is switched off with it.
Read this whole brief once, then work from the tables. When in doubt, prefer the smallest mod that plays.

## What a mod is

A folder:

```
my-mod/
  mod.json          the manifest: the mod's identity, its defs, and the sheets they draw with
  sprites/*.png     optional art (a def without any is drawn as a plain placeholder)
  README.md         optional
```

Published mods live in https://github.com/steel-tide/mods under `mods/<id>/`; the game lists that registry under Settings → Mods, and the website at https://steelti.de/mods.

## The manifest, minimal

One vanilla unit copied and re-tuned. `extends` inherits everything (art, weapons, where it is built) and every field you name overrides it:

```json
{
  "format": "steel-tide-mod",
  "v": 1,
  "id": "bison-ii",
  "name": [
    "Bison II",
    "野牛 II"

        }
      ],
      "aiWeight": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

## The manifest, deeper

Own art, a defended building, and a fourth level for a vanilla building line:

| `interceptMuzzleOffset` | number 0–200 |  |  | point defence: launcher length, world px |
| `transportCap` | integer 1–50 | units only |  | a transport: hold, in cargo weight |
| `cargoReach` | number 0.5–4 | units only | 1 | a transport: how far its load and unload distances stretch, as a multiple of the default (the landing craft's and the Moray's 1.1) |

| `trail` | tread \| tire \| wake | units only | by domain | the mark it leaves |
| `sprite` | string |  | this mod's u.<id> sheet, else the base's art | the body's atlas key: one of this mod's sheets, or a vanilla key to borrow its art |
| `turretSprite` | string |  | this mod's tur.<id> sheet, else the base's (when its art is kept) | the rotating part's key, if any |
| `aliases` | string[] |  |  | other names the console's `give` accepts |
| `aiWeight` | number 0–10 | units only | 0 | how readily the AI builds it: a Bison is 3, a scout car 1; 0 never |

Defaults when `extends` is absent: a unit is `domain: "ground"`, `tier: 1`, `pop: 1`, `speed: 60`, `turnRate: 3.5`, `vision: 8`, `radius: 9`, no `body` (units part on the circle of `radius`), armour by domain (ground `medium`, ship `ship`, air `air`), a tread trail on land and a wake at sea; a building is `fw: 2, fh: 2`, `armor: "structure"`, `power: 0`, `pop: 0`. `buildTime` defaults to cost ÷ 14 seconds.
Where a unit is built when `producedBy` is absent: its domain's line from its tier up (ground: T1 → factory+factory2+factory3, T2 → factory2+factory3, T3 → factory3; ship: T1 → navyard+navyard2+navyard3, T2 → navyard2+navyard3, T3 → navyard3; air: T1 → airbase+airbase2+airbase3, T2 → airbase2+airbase3, T3 → airbase3).
An `upgradeOf` def becomes upgrade-only (never placed directly): the named building gains an Upgrade button that turns it into this def, at `upgradeCost` over `upgradeTime`. A building may have only one next level, so `upgradeOf` can name a vanilla building at the end of its line (`power3`, `factory3`, `extractor3`, `gatling`, `cannonturret2`, `samsite`, `interceptor2`, `radar`, `repairtower`, `reactor`, `nukesilo`) or one of this mod's.

### A weapon (`defs[].weapons[]`)

```

### A sheet (`sprites[]`)

| field | type | required | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `key` | string | yes |  | `u.<id>` for a body, `tur.<id>` for a rotating part; never a vanilla key |
| `file` | string | yes |  | the image, relative to mod.json (PNG, WebP or JPEG) |

| `pivotX` | number 0–1 |  | 0.5 | rotation pivot, as a fraction of the frame |
| `pivotY` | number 0–1 |  | 0.5 | rotation pivot, as a fraction of the frame |

| `stabilize` | boolean |  | true | re-align drifting frames |
| `freezeStatic` | boolean |  |  | median-freeze pixels that barely change |
| `stripBg` | boolean |  |  | force background removal on or off |
| `bgMinLuma` | number 0–255 |  |  | lightest colour still taken as background |
| `artifactCleanup` | boolean |  |  | sweep specks left by background removal |

### A sound (`sounds[]`)

| field | type | required | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `key` | string | yes |  | `<mod id>-<name>`, lower case; what a weapon's `sound` names |
| `file` | string | yes |  | the recording, relative to mod.json. An MP3 plays everywhere; WAV works, OGG not on Safari. Dry, close, under a second |

A weapon fires with the game's sound for its class unless its `sound` names one of these keys. A recording is a dry, close-miked one-shot under a second with no reverb tail; the engine attenuates and pans it by distance, and forty overlapping echoes turn to mud. Mono MP3 is the safe format.

## Units of measure

- A tile is 32 world pixels. `speed` and projectile `speed` are world px/s; `range`, `minRange`, `vision`, `sonar`, `stealth`, `detect`, `repairRange` and `interceptRange` are tiles; `radius`, `body.r`, `body.len`, `splash`, `spread`, `muzzleOffset` are world px.
- Times are seconds: `buildTime`, `reload`, `burstDelay`, `upgradeTime`, `interceptReload`, `nukeTime`.
- For scale: the Bison main battle tank is cost 280, hp 620, speed 60, radius 10, body `{ r: 13, len: 12 }`, a cannon of dmg 60 every 1.8 s at range 4.6; a scout car is cost 60, hp 150, speed 120; a war factory is 3×3 tiles, hp 1500, power −8.

## Art

- Keys: a def's body is `u.<id>`, a rotating turret `tur.<id>`. A def with no sheet of its own may borrow vanilla art by naming a vanilla key in `sprite` (e.g. `"sprite": "u.mbt", "turretSprite": "tur.mbt"`); with `extends` it inherits the base's art. A mod may not replace vanilla art.
- A sheet is one PNG (WebP and JPEG are accepted): `frames` animation frames left to right in one horizontal strip, evenly spaced, no gaps, no borders.
- Hulls, turrets and everything that turns: draw ONE image facing UP and set `"rotated": true`; the game bakes the 24 headings. `fw`/`fh` are the in-game size of that up-facing image in world px (a tank hull is about 24×24; the image itself may be any resolution, 2–4× is best). `pivotX`/`pivotY` put the pivot on the turret ring (default centre).
- Buildings: one strip of frames, not rotated, drawn with a slight top-down southern tilt. The footprint is the bottom `fw×32` by `fh×32` px of the frame; anything above overhangs the terrain behind (towers, masts). Width, height and anchor are sized from the def's footprint automatically.
- A building with a gun that turns is two sheets like a hull and turret: the body with an empty ring and `"mount": [fx, fy]` saying where the ring sits as fractions of the frame, and a `tur.<id>` sheet for the gun; its weapons carry `"turret": true`.
- Faction colour: paint team-coloured parts in pure magenta (highlight #FF66FF, base #FF00FF, shadow #990099) and use magenta nowhere else; the game recolours it per player.
- Style: crisp pixel art, hard edges, no anti-aliasing, a muted military palette (DawnBringer-32), dark #222034 outlines. Generated sheets are cleaned automatically (background removal, frame registration), but a transparent background is best.

## Test

1. Validate: in a clone of the registry, `node tools/check.mjs path/to/my-mod` prints every error with its path into mod.json. (No clone? The game says the same things when the mod is loaded.)
2. Load it in the game: Settings → Mods → *Open folder…* (Chrome keeps the folder open, so *Reload* re-reads your edits) or *Upload file…* (a zip of the folder, or a `.steel-tide-mod` file). Errors are listed on the spot; a loaded mod says how many units and buildings it added.
3. Play: start a Conquest match. Your units are in the factory's production list from the level you gave them; buildings are in the engineer's build menu; an upgrade level is on its building's Upgrade button. The console (backquote) has `give <id>` for anything. Mods apply to Conquest and the campaign; a networked match is always unmodded.
4. From a static server: `npx serve --cors path/to/my-mod` then open `https://play.steelti.de/?mod=http://localhost:3000/` — the mod is fetched at every boot, so a page reload picks up an edit.

## Publish

1. Fork https://github.com/steel-tide/mods, add your folder as `mods/<id>/` (the folder name is the mod's `id`), run `node tools/check.mjs mods/<id>`, open a pull request.
2. CI runs the same check on the whole registry: ids must be unique across every published mod, so prefix a generic word with your mod's id (`ironworks-bunker`, not `bunker`).
3. Once merged, the index is rebuilt and the mod appears in the game's registry list and at https://steelti.de/mods. Bump `version` for every change; the game offers the update.

## Rules

- A mod adds; it does not change vanilla defs, art, rules or interface. Do not try to override a vanilla id or key; the validator refuses it.
- Keep it honest: a unit needs a counter. The armour matrix is how the game makes one; give a new weapon a class it belongs to rather than an override on every cell.
- A mod is published under the licence its manifest names (default CC-BY-4.0). Only ship art you have the right to.
