# Rusted Expansion — how its sheets and sounds are made

Everything the mod draws and plays is generated with the game's own pipeline
(`game/core/docs/ASSETS-GENERATION.md`): the sheets by `sprites:gen` through
the Vercel AI Gateway, the sounds by `sfx:gen` through ElevenLabs. Nothing of
Rusted Warfare's ships with the mod. What carries over is the *look*: each
sheet's prompt names one frame of the corresponding Rusted Warfare sprite,
blown up pixel for pixel, on its `refs:` line, and asks the model for an
original, more detailed interpretation that keeps the silhouette, the
proportions, the layout of features and the places the faction colour sits —
not a copy. The reference frames are cut from the game's package by
`import-rw.py --refs` into `rusted-warfare/refs/` (git-ignored, beside the
unzipped package) and are not part of the mod. The sounds are prompted from
measurements of the originals (their length, brightness and envelope), which
is the only thing that can be carried into a sound generator.

From the registry root, with the game beside it:

```sh
MOD=$PWD/mods/rusted-expansion
pnpm -C ../steel-tide/game/core sprites:gen --doc $MOD/PROMPTS.md --out $MOD/sprites --missing
pnpm -C ../steel-tide/game/core sfx:gen --doc $MOD/PROMPTS.md --out $MOD/sfx --all
pnpm -C ../steel-tide/game/core sfx --src $MOD/sfx --out $MOD/sounds
python3 $MOD/measure-masters.py
```

(`sfx/` holds the raw takes and is git-ignored; `sounds/` is the cut the mod
ships. The generators resolve a relative `--doc` against `game/core`, so the
paths above are absolute.)

The masters land at the model's own aspect ratio, and the loader stretches a
sheet to its `fw`×`fh`, so every entry asks for a size on the model's ratio
list and the manifest keeps that ratio: hulls 9:16 or 2:3, the bomber 1:1,
the battleship 1:3, and every turret 1:2, asked for with its ring at 60% of
the height. Sizes are whole pixels: a fractional `fw` made the loader's
resampler run past the row and the hull came out a streaked ghost. Where the
ring and the barrels actually landed is measured off the finished masters by
`measure-masters.py --apply` (`pivotY`, `mount`, `muzzleOffset`,
`boreSpacing`), not guessed.

## Sheets

Shared rules, in every prompt: crisp pixel art on a strict grid, a transparent
background, the game's greys and its dark outline, faction colour as pure
magenta where Rusted Warfare painted green, nothing else magenta, no ground,
no shadow, no text.

#### Tank — hull — `u.rusted-tank.png`

refs: ../../../steel-tide-mods/rusted-warfare/refs/tank-hull.png

```text
Pixel-art sprite for a 2D real-time strategy game, PNG with fully transparent background, ONE single static image exactly 576×1024 pixels. No animation frames, no strip, no border, no label, no text, and no background of any kind.

Reference: the attached picture is a tiny classic mobile-RTS tank hull blown up pixel for pixel. Keep its silhouette, its proportions, the layout of its features and the places its green panels sit, but paint an ORIGINAL, more detailed interpretation for this game — do not trace or copy it.

Subject: a small, plain, boxy medium tank HULL WITHOUT ITS TURRET, seen from directly above, facing straight up toward the top edge and centered in the image, filling the height. A narrow rectangular hull between two full-length tracks with visible tread links, a flat front glacis with a small driver's hatch, a raised engine deck at the rear with a grille, and one empty dark circular turret mounting ring exactly at the image center. Do not draw a turret, gun, or barrel.

Style: crisp pixel art on a strict pixel grid, hard edges, no anti-aliasing halos, no blur, no glow; cool blue-tinted military steel from this palette: #9badb7 #847e87 #696a6a #595652 #323c39, with dark #222034 silhouette outlines.

Faction markers: where the reference is green — the two rear deck panels, one behind each track — paint pure magenta only: highlight #FF66FF, base #FF00FF, shadow #990099. Magenta appears nowhere else.

Isolation rule: no ground, no cast shadow, no terrain, no track marks. The engine draws the shadow itself and composites the turret onto the center ring.

#### Tank — turret — `tur.rusted-tank.png`

refs: ../../../steel-tide-mods/rusted-warfare/refs/tank-turret.png

```text
Pixel-art sprite for a 2D real-time strategy game, PNG with fully transparent background, ONE single static image exactly 512×1024 pixels. No animation frames, no strip, no border, no label, no text, and no background of any kind.

Reference: the attached picture is a tiny classic mobile-RTS tank turret blown up pixel for pixel: a small round dome with one long thin barrel. Keep that character — small dome, long thin gun — but paint an ORIGINAL, more detailed interpretation for this game; do not trace or copy it.

Subject: a small round tank turret seen from directly above, facing straight up toward the top edge and centered horizontally: a compact domed turret body with a closed hatch and a single long, thin cannon barrel with a small muzzle extending straight up to the top edge of the image. The turret's mounting-ring center sits on the vertical centerline at exactly 60% of the image height from the top; the barrel extends upward from it with no perspective bend, and the body reaches no lower than 80% of the height. Leave the sides transparent — the turret is narrow.

Style: crisp pixel art on a strict pixel grid, hard edges, no anti-aliasing halos, no blur, no glow; cool blue-tinted military steel from this palette: #9badb7 #847e87 #696a6a #595652 #323c39, with dark #222034 silhouette outlines. No magenta on this part.

Isolation rule: no ground, no cast shadow, no hull, no muzzle flash, no base plate. This part rotates in-engine on top of the separate tank hull. Keep the mounting-ring center fixed at 60% image height.

Reference: the attached picture is a tiny classic mobile-RTS heavy tank hull blown up pixel for pixel. Keep its silhouette, its proportions, the layout of its features and the places its green blocks sit, but paint an ORIGINAL, more detailed interpretation for this game — do not trace or copy it.

Subject: a wide, slab-sided heavy tank HULL WITHOUT ITS TURRET, seen from directly above, facing straight up toward the top edge and centered in the image, filling the height. Two very wide full-length tracks with heavy tread links, a thick flat glacis with bolted armor plates and a notch at the front center, a broad flat deck, twin exhaust stacks at the rear corners, and one empty dark circular turret mounting ring exactly at the image center. Do not draw a turret, gun, missile or barrel.

Style: crisp pixel art on a strict pixel grid, hard edges, no anti-aliasing halos, no blur, no glow; cool blue-tinted military steel from this palette: #9badb7 #847e87 #696a6a #595652 #323c39, with dark #222034 silhouette outlines.

Faction markers: where the reference is green — one armor block on the outer edge of each track guard near the front and one near the rear, four in all — paint pure magenta only: highlight #FF66FF, base #FF00FF, shadow #990099. Magenta appears nowhere else.

Isolation rule: no ground, no cast shadow, no terrain, no track marks. The engine draws the shadow itself and composites the turret onto the center ring.

Pixel-art sprite for a 2D real-time strategy game, PNG with fully transparent background, ONE single static image exactly 576×1024 pixels. No animation frames, no strip, no border, no label, no text, and no background of any kind.

Reference: the attached picture is a tiny classic mobile-RTS attack helicopter blown up pixel for pixel, drawn without its rotor. Keep its silhouette, its proportions, the layout of its features and the place its green band sits, but paint an ORIGINAL, more detailed interpretation for this game — do not trace or copy it.

Subject: a stubby attack helicopter seen from directly above, facing straight up toward the top edge and centered in the image, filling the height: a rounded bulbous nose with a dark tinted canopy, a short thick fuselage with the rotor hub (a small dark disc, NO blades) at the exact image center, a short stub wing on each side carrying one small gun pod, a slim tail boom running straight down to a small T-tail with a tiny tail rotor. Do not draw the main rotor blades — the engine spins them itself.

Style: crisp pixel art on a strict pixel grid, hard edges, no anti-aliasing halos, no blur, no glow; olive-grey airframe from this palette: #847e87 #696a6a #595652 #4b692f #323c39, canopy glass #5fcde4 shaded #306082, with dark #222034 silhouette outlines.

Reference: the attached picture is a tiny classic mobile-RTS gun boat hull blown up pixel for pixel. Keep its silhouette, its proportions, the layout of its features and the places its green bands sit, but paint an ORIGINAL, more detailed interpretation for this game — do not trace or copy it.

Subject: a small fast patrol gun boat HULL WITHOUT ITS GUN, seen from directly above, bow pointing straight up toward the top edge and centered in the image, filling the height: a teardrop hull with a sharp bow and a rounded stern, a low raised deckhouse aft of the middle, a small dark engine hatch at the stern, and one empty dark circular mounting ring exactly at the image center where the gun will sit. Do not draw a gun or barrel.

Style: crisp pixel art on a strict pixel grid, hard edges, no anti-aliasing halos, no blur, no glow; light naval grey from this palette: #cbdbfc #9badb7 #847e87 #696a6a #595652 #323c39, with dark #222034 silhouette outlines.

Faction markers: where the reference is green — a chevron at the bow tip and one band across the deck just aft of the mounting ring — paint pure magenta only: highlight #FF66FF, base #FF00FF, shadow #990099. Magenta appears nowhere else.

Isolation rule: no water, no wake, no cast shadow, no terrain. The engine draws the wake and composites the gun onto the ring.

## Sounds

Prompted from measurements of Rusted Warfare's recordings — the tank's shot
is a deep bass thud with almost nothing above 400 Hz, the heavy and naval
guns bright cracks around 1.4 kHz, the gun boat's a thin snap near 2 kHz, the
missile a mid hiss — in the game's own one-shot format (`SFX-PROMPTS.md`).
Every slot is a `rusted-expansion-` key the weapons name. Two takes each; the
cut keeps the better one.
