# FG Rusted League (FG 铁锈联盟)

A port of *FG铁锈联盟*, a Rusted Warfare build by 空中之主 with art by 有人, 基卡
and SS元首, made with the author's permission. It is not a mod folder but a
whole Rusted Warfare 1.13.3 package with its army redrawn: the builder, the
tanks, the factories and the turrets, every hull in black and acid green, under
a Red Alert roster's names — the Grizzly, the Prism tank, the Tesla tank, the
Patriot battery. On top of that sits its own plugin, *GF插件*, with carriers,
dreadnoughts, sky fortresses, a nuclear submarine, a superweapon or two and a
hero tank that ranks up.

What comes across is the roster, the art, and the behaviour the game's mod
rules can carry: units that change shape, a hero that ranks itself up, a tank
that hides as a tree, shields, beams and bases that go up like bombs. What
stays behind is the rest of the original's scripting: the money buttons, the
bug faction the command centre could be switched to (its art is Rusted
Warfare's own), and the carriers' planes launching of their own accord.

## What is in it

A League base starts from the **League Command**, which the engineer places —
or the Multi-Role Rocket Truck, which carries one in the original. It trains the
League's **Builder**, and the builder places everything else; the Construction
Ship and the Supply Ship place the naval base and defences from the water.

Some of its units build others, as they do in the original: the Lord of the Sky
and the Battle Carrier launch helicopters, jets and gunships, the Light Carrier
its Wasps, the Judgment-class battleship support ships and amphibious tanks,
the Littoral Combat Ship submarines and ASW planes, the Battlecruiser its hover
escorts, the Laser UFO the teleporter, and the rocket truck artillery, tank
destroyers and submarines. Select one and its production is on the card beside
its orders; each unit it builds is launched beside it, wherever it has got to.

33 buildings:

| building | what it does |
| --- | --- |
| League Command | trains the builder, guns down anything in range, earns 1.75 a second, +20 power |
| Army Base → II | the tanks and vehicles |
| Air Force Base → II | helicopters and jets |
| Naval Base → II | the fleet, and the flying Aircraft Carrier; stands on the water by a shore |
| Ore Mine → II → III | an extractor on a deposit, 1.4, 3 and 8 a second |
| Sentry Gun → II → III, Artillery Emplacement, Flamethrower Turret | ground defences |
| Patriot Missile → II → Absolute Domain, Flak Cannon | air defences; the Absolute Domain hits the ground too |
| Prism Defence Tower → II | shoots down shells and missiles aimed at the base |
| Repair Depot | mends what is parked nearby |
| Battle Lab | unlocks the top tier: the T3 factory, the black-tech factory, the silo, the superweapons |
| T3 Factory | the Apocalypse, the Mirage tank, the V3, the Kirov, the Lord of the Sky |
| Black-Tech Factory | the Experimental Tank, the Star Warship, the Battlecruiser, the B-52, the Laser UFO |
| Tactical Airfield | the gunship platforms |
| Nuclear Missile Silo | builds and launches warheads |
| Colossus Gun, Proton Collider Cannon | long guns; the proton cannon reaches across the map |
| Floating Array | an alien platform that hovers over the base |
| Overloaded Nuclear Generator | money, fast |
| Hero Barracks, Hero Tower | the barracks trains the hero tank; the tower lets a Lv3 hero reach its MAX |

90 units: 26 on the ground, 25 in the air, 17 at sea and the 22 ranks of the
hero tank. Two of them are forms rather than units a line builds: the Mirage's
disguise and the Amphibious Jet under water.

The hero tank ranks up as it does in the original. The barracks trains the
Lv1 tank. Its card offers three Lv2 lines, each of those three Lv3s, and each
Lv3 its MAX. The tank changes in place: it keeps its orders, its kills and
its share of health. Each rank costs the difference between the two ranks'
prices and takes the time that metal would buy. One Lv3 of each line needs a
standing Army Base II (the original's second-level mech factory), and every
MAX needs a Hero Tower. The computer ranks its heroes up too.

The shape-changers change shape from their cards: the Tengu between jet and
mech, the Striker between gunship and walker, the Skyshaker and the Jiaolong
between air and sea, and the Amphibious Jet between flying and diving under
the sea. The change takes a few seconds, is free, and waits for ground the
new form can stand on.

The Mirage tank turns into a tree once it has stood still for a second. It
turns back into a tank the moment it moves or fires. As a tree it is seen only
from three tiles away, and nothing on the other side can be ordered to fire on
it; a blast still reaches it. In the original the tank stays hidden while it
moves too. Here it shows itself when it moves, as in Red Alert, and as the
tank's frames say: two tank frames for moving and three tree frames for
standing.

Units with a shield in the original have one here, drawn over the health bar,
which recharges a little after the last hit. Units that mend themselves in the
original do here, at no more than half a percent of their hull a second. The
Tesla tank, the Prism tank, the Shield Tank, the Laser UFO, the Wasp and a few
heroes fire beams: a laser, or a lightning bolt that jumps from gun to target.
The V3, the Battlecruiser and the Skyshaker fly their own rounds. The Lord of
the Sky, the Battlecruiser, the Battle Carrier and the Supply Ship earn metal,
as they do in the original. The reactor, the battle lab, the proton cannon,
the hero tower, the B-52, the Battlecruiser and the teleporter blow up where
they die. The blast spares their own side.

## The map

*Proving Ground* (试验场, `maps/proving-ground.steel-tide-map`) stands the
whole mod on one field: every building and every unit in it, 132 pieces (the
Mirage puts on its own disguise). Seat 0
opens in the south-west on a League base built out along the north edge — the
command, the factories and their second levels, the three ore mines, the
turret line, the labs and the superweapons — with the army formed up on the
plain, the heroes in their ranks, the air wing over the base and the fleet in
the bay beside the two naval bases. Seat 1 opens in the east behind a Steel
Tide army dug in across the rough ground. `make-map.py` writes it from the
roster, and fails if a def is missing or a piece would overlap another or
stand on the wrong ground.

## The numbers

The League keeps Rusted Warfare's own balance, so its numbers go through the
calibration the Rusted Expansion mod uses for Rusted Warfare's stock roster:
prices ×0.8, hit points ×2.9, ranges ×0.7 in tiles and damage ×1.6, so its
Grizzly lands beside the Bison. The plugin's giants are compressed at the top —
the Battlecruiser costs 75 000 in the original, and is capped at 6000 metal
here — and every unit's damage a second is kept within sight of its price.
Buildings are priced ×0.6 and armoured ×1.25, the way the game's own are.
Income follows the original's extractor: its 8 credits a second is this game's
1.4 metal.

The numbers of the units Rusted Warfare hard-codes — the builder, the tank,
the factories and the turrets — live in its bytecode, not in an ini file.
`rw-dex.py` reads them out of the package's `classes.dex` with the Android SDK's
`dexdump` into `rw-core.json`.

## The art

Only the League's own pictures ship. Every image the converter uses is compared
with the same file in a stock Rusted Warfare build, and one that matches it is
Corroding Games' art and is left out. The Mega Tank, the Ladybug, the dropship,
the anti-nuke, the fabricator and the supply depot kept their stock look in
the League, so they are not here; nor are the bugs.

Helicopters carry their rotor spinning in their frames in the original; the
converter keeps the pixels most frames agree on, which is the hull, and the
game lays its own rotor over it. The Light Carrier and the Aircraft Carrier
also launch planes of their own accord in the original, which here are their
guns. Weapons fire with the game's own sounds for their kind.

The art of the Strategic Bomber comes, the original says, from *未来战争*
("Future War").

## Rebuilding

The package is not part of this repository. With it unpacked at
`rusted-warfare-mods/skycraft` and a stock Rusted Warfare at `rusted-warfare`:

```
python3 mods/fg-rusted-league/port-fg.py
python3 mods/fg-rusted-league/make-map.py
```

`--dry` prints the conversion without writing, `--dump <name>` a unit's merged
ini. `rw-dex.py` only needs rerunning for a different build of the package.
