"""Write the mod's map, `maps/proving-ground.steel-tide-map`: the whole of the League on one field.

A map a mod carries (`maps` in mod.json) is a file the Map Editor could have exported —
terrain, deposits, spawns, props and the pieces standing before the whistle — and it may
stand the mod's own units. This one is drawn here rather than in the editor so it follows
the roster: every building and every unit in `mod.json` stands on it. Seat 0 opens in the
west on a League base built out to the top — the command, the factories and their second
levels, the three ore mines, the turret line, the labs and the superweapons — with the
army formed up on the plain, the heroes in their ranks, the air wing over the base and the
fleet in the bay. Seat 1 opens in the east with a Steel Tide army dug in across the plain.

Tiles are 32 world px; a building sits on its top-left tile; a unit's `a` is its facing in
degrees clockwise from east. Pieces that would overlap, stand on the wrong ground or leave a
def out fail the run, since the game drops an overlapping piece without a word.
