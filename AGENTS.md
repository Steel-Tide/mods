# Making a Steel Tide mod: a brief for a coding agent

You are helping make a mod for Steel Tide (https://steelti.de), a browser real-time strategy game.
A mod adds units, buildings and upgrade levels, and gives them behaviour of their own — forms they turn into, units they spawn, buttons on their cards, planes they carry, weapons that look like nothing in the game (see Behaviour). It cannot change the game's rules, its interface, or an existing unit or building: it only adds, and everything it adds is switched off with it.
Read this whole brief once, then work from the tables. When in doubt, prefer the smallest mod that plays.

## What a mod is

A folder:

```
my-mod/
  mod.json          the manifest: the mod's identity, its defs, and the sheets they draw with
  sprites/*.png     optional art (a def without any is drawn as a plain placeholder)
  screenshots/*.png the mod in play, 4:3 (the registry asks for at least one; see Publish)
  maps/*.steel-tide-map  optional maps from the Scenario Editor, offered in the setup screens while the mod is on (see Maps)
  README.md         optional
```

Published mods live in https://github.com/steel-tide/mods under `mods/<id>/`; the game lists that registry under Settings → Mods, and the website at https://steelti.de/mods.

## The manifest, minimal

One vanilla unit copied and re-tuned. `extends` inherits everything (art, weapons, where it is built) and every field you name overrides it:

```json

```

## The manifest, deeper

Own art, a defended building, and a fourth level for a vanilla building line:

## Fields

Anything not in these tables is ignored with a warning. Numbers outside the stated range are errors.

### mod.json (top level)

| field | type | required | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `format` | string | yes |  | always "steel-tide-mod" |
| `v` | integer 1–1 | yes |  | format version, 1 |
| `id` | id | yes |  | the mod's id: lower case, letters, digits, `-`; also its folder in the registry |
| `name` | text | yes |  | the name shown in the mod list |
| `version` | string | yes |  | e.g. `1.0.0`; the game offers an update when the registry's is newer |
| `author` | string |  |  | who made it |
| `description` | text |  |  | one or two sentences for the list |
| `homepage` | string |  |  | a link: a repository, a thread |
| `license` | string |  | CC-BY-4.0 | the mod's licence (SPDX id) |
| `minGame` | string |  |  | the oldest game version it is written for |
| `defs` | def[] | yes |  | the units, buildings and upgrade levels |
| `sprites` | sheet[] |  |  | the sheets the defs draw with (see below) |
| `sounds` | string |  |  | the recordings the weapons fire with (see below) |
| `screenshots` | path[] |  |  | pictures of the mod in play, relative to mod.json (`screenshots/1.png`): 4:3, at least 640 px wide, under 2 MB each, up to 8. The registry asks for at least one and shows them on the mod's page |
| `maps` | string |  |  | maps the mod carries, relative to mod.json (`maps/city.steel-tide-map`): files exported from the Scenario Editor, up to 8, each under 512 KB. A map may stand the mod's own units; the setup screens offer it beside the player's own map while the mod is on |
| `files` | { path: dataURL } |  |  | single-file form only: the sheets, sounds and maps, embedded as data URLs by path |

`name`, `description` and every `desc`/`name` on a def are *text*: a string (used for every language), `["English", "中文", "한국어"]` in that order, or `{ "en": "…", "zh": "…", "ko": "…" }`. Only English is required; a language left out reads as English.

### A def (`defs[]`)

| field | type | required | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | id | yes |  | unique across every mod and the vanilla roster; prefix a generic word with your mod's id |
| `name` | text | yes |  | as the HUD shows it |
| `desc` | text |  | "" | the tooltip line |
| `extends` | id |  |  | a vanilla def id (or an earlier def of this mod) to copy, then override field by field; inherits its art and where it is built |
| `kind` | unit \| building | yes |  | a unit or a building (required unless `extends` says) |
| `domain` | ground \| ship \| air \| amphibious | units only | ground | where it moves; a submarine is a `ship` with `underwater`, and an `amphibious` hull drives and swims (a ship target afloat, a ground one ashore) |
| `tier` | integer 1–3 |  | 1 | the factory level it appears at, and the badge |
| `cost` | number 0–99999 | yes |  | metal |
| `buildTime` | number 0–3600 |  | cost ÷ 14 | seconds at full power |
| `pop` | integer 0–50 |  | 1 for a unit, 0 for a building | population it counts for |
| `hp` | number 1–1000000 | yes |  | hit points |
| `armor` | light \| medium \| heavy \| ship \| sub \| air \| structure |  | by domain | the armour class weapons are multiplied against |
| `speed` | number 0–1000 | units only | 60 | world px/s (a tile is 32) |
| `turnRate` | number 0–50 | units only | 3.5 | rad/s |
| `vision` | number 0–64 |  | 8 | sight, in tiles |
| `radius` | number 1–200 |  | 9, or the footprint | collision radius, world px, and the *combat* yardstick: range, splash and hits are measured to it |
| `body` | { r, len } | units only | the circle of `radius` | the room the hull takes up when units push each other apart, world px: `r` its half-width, `len` its length less the two round ends. A long hull is what a circle cannot say. A ship whose beam (`r` twice) is over a tile (32) needs that many tiles of water abeam, rounded up: it never enters a channel narrower than itself |
| `weapons` | weapon[] |  | [] | the weapons (see below); an empty list is unarmed |
| `fw` | integer 1–8 | buildings only | 2 | footprint width, tiles |
| `fh` | integer 1–8 | buildings only | 2 | footprint height, tiles |
| `producedBy` | id[] | units only | the line for its domain, from its tier up | the buildings whose production list it joins (vanilla or this mod's), or units of this mod that train it (a carrier) |
| `produces` | id[] |  |  | a factory: the units it builds. On a unit, a carrier or a mothership that trains them itself: each is launched beside it, wherever it has got to |
| `builtBy` | id[] | buildings only | ["engineer"] | the builder units that may place it |
| `builds` | id[] | units only |  | a builder unit: the buildings it can construct |
| `buildRate` | number 0–10000 | units only |  | a builder unit: hp of work per second |
| `reach` | number 0–256 | units only |  | a builder unit: how far past a target's radius it works from, world px (the engineer's 46 when unset; the engineer boat's 64) |
| `power` | number -10000–10000 |  | −pop for a unit, 0 for a building | positive produces, negative draws; every unit draws its population |
| `metalRate` | number 0–1000 |  |  | metal per second: an extractor, or a unit that earns (a supply ship) |
| `needsDeposit` | boolean | buildings only |  | must stand on a deposit |
| `offshore` | boolean | buildings only |  | stands in open water on its own legs: every footprint tile sea, no shore needed; with needsDeposit, an ore field at sea, which only a builder on the water (the engineer boat) can reach |
| `wall` | boolean | buildings only |  | a wall: one tile that joins its neighbours of the same def (its sheet is sixteen frames, one per set of neighbours: north 1, east 2, south 4, west 8), the last thing a gun shoots at, untouched by a pulse, and it falls without a charge |
| `repairRange` | number 0–64 | buildings only |  | a repair aura, tiles |
| `repairRate` | number 0–10000 | buildings only |  | hp per second per target |
| `repairTargets` | integer 1–50 | buildings only |  | targets served at once |
| `upgradeOf` | id | buildings only |  | the building this is the next level of; that one gains the upgrade button |
| `upgradeCost` | number 0–99999 | buildings only | cost − the source's cost | with `upgradeOf`: the upgrade's price |
| `upgradeTime` | number 0–3600 | buildings only | buildTime | with `upgradeOf`: seconds |
| `requires` | id[] |  |  | building ids that must stand before it can be built, or tech node ids that must be researched (`suicideDrones`, `activeProtection`…) |
| `nukeCapacity` | integer 0–10 |  |  | a launcher: warheads it holds |
| `nukeCost` | number 0–99999 |  |  | a launcher: metal per warhead |
| `nukeTime` | number 0–3600 |  |  | a launcher: seconds per warhead |
| `armsAtBase` | number 0–64 | units only |  | a launcher: fabricates its warheads only within this many tiles of one of its own bases of its kind (a naval yard for a hull, an airbase for an aircraft; and, an `underwater` one, only on the surface), and holds the work otherwise (the Kraken's and the Wraith's 4) |
| `hatch` | number 0–30 |  |  | a launcher: seconds its doors take to open before the warhead leaves, and to close after; none fires on the spot |
| `antiWarhead` | boolean |  |  | its anti-air may fire on a nuclear warhead without a veteran's rank |
| `interceptRange` | number 0–64 |  |  | point defence: reach in tiles |
| `interceptMag` | integer 1–200 |  |  | point defence: rounds ready |
| `interceptReload` | number 0.05–600 |  |  | point defence: seconds per round replaced |
| `interceptMuzzleOffset` | number 0–200 |  |  | point defence: launcher length, world px |
| `transportCap` | integer 1–50 | units only |  | a transport: hold, in cargo weight |
| `cargoReach` | number 0.5–4 | units only | 1 | a transport: how far its load and unload distances stretch, as a multiple of the default (the landing craft's 1.1, the Moray's 1.5); on a ship it widens the ground its ramp reaches too |
| `landsForCargo` | boolean | units only |  | a cargo plane that touches down to load |
| `cargoWeight` | number 0–50 | units only | pop | how much of a hold it takes |
| `underwater` | boolean | units only |  | a submarine: seen only by sonar |
| `sonar` | number 0–64 | units only |  | sonar range, tiles |
| `stealth` | number 0–64 | units only |  | seen only within this many tiles of an enemy |
| `detect` | number 0–64 |  |  | reveals stealth within this many tiles |
| `radar` | boolean |  |  | sees by radio: the sight circle ignores weather and the hour, and drops to 7 tiles when short of power |
| `hovers` | boolean | units only |  | an aircraft that hovers instead of orbiting |
| `kamikaze` | boolean | units only |  | the unit is its own round: it never picks a target, and its one weapon flies it into what it is ordered at (the Hornet) |
| `lowFlying` | boolean | units only |  | an aircraft at treetop height: machine guns and autocannons that fire on the ground reach it too (the Hornet) |
| `limit` | integer 1–200 | units only |  | at most this many a faction at once, alive and queued together (the Hornet's 6) |
| `altitude` | number 0–64 | units only | 12 | an aircraft's drawn height, px |
| `fireOnMove` | boolean | units only |  | keeps shooting on a plain move |
| `burnMult` | number 0–4 | units only | 1 | what fire on the ground does to it, as a multiplier (the Drake's 0.5) |
| `trail` | tread \| tire \| wake \| none | units only | by domain | the mark it leaves, and the sound of it: treads and tyres are heard rolling; `none` for a unit on foot or a hovercraft, which neither cuts a rut nor is heard as an engine |
| `shadow` | boolean |  | true | the shadow the game casts for it: a unit's hull and turret silhouettes, a step to the south-east on the ground, further off in the air; a building's gun's, on its roof; `false` when the art brings its own, or none is wanted (a submarine casts none) |
| `sprite` | string |  | this mod's u.<id> sheet, else the base's art | the body's atlas key: one of this mod's sheets, or a vanilla key to borrow its art |
| `turretSprite` | string |  | this mod's tur.<id> sheet, else the base's (when its art is kept) | the rotating part's key, if any |
| `turretMounts` | mount[] |  | one, where the body sheet's `mount` puts it (else the pivot); the base's, when its art is kept | the rings its turret stands on and fires from, up to 8: a hull with several guns names one each (a battleship's A, B and X), every one drawn with the one `turretSprite` and trained on the one target, as far round as its own arc goes (see below) |
| `decals` | decal[] |  | the base's, when its art is kept | pictures laid on the hull and the turret besides their own sheets (see below), up to 12 |
| `ability` | sprint \| afterburner \| smoke \| incendiary \| barrage \| countermeasures \| damageControl \| emergencyRepair | units only | the base's | its one active ability, a vanilla one by id (`sprint`, `smoke`, `countermeasures`…): the same click, clock and unlock as on the game's own units |
| `aliases` | string[] |  |  | other names the console's `give` accepts |
| `aiWeight` | number 0–10 | units only | 0 | how readily the AI builds it: a Bison is 3, a scout car 1; 0 never |
| `rules` | rule[] |  |  | its behaviour: rules that turn it into another form, spawn, heal, pay, buff or blow up, on an event, a condition, a clock or a button (see Behaviour), up to 24; never inherited through `extends` |
| `shield` | { hp, regen, delay } |  |  | an energy shield, `{ hp, regen, delay }`: it takes harm before the hull does, and recharges `regen` a second once unhurt for `delay` seconds |
| `regen` | number 0–10000 |  |  | hit points a second it mends itself by |
| `untargetable` | boolean |  |  | nothing on the other side may pick it as a target or be ordered to attack it; a blast still reaches it (a disguise, a decoy) |
| `wing` | { unit, count, rebuild, sortie, rearm, range } | units only |  | a carrier: planes of this mod it keeps aboard, `{ unit, count, rebuild, sortie, rearm, range }`, sent out at what it fights, taken back to rearm and made again when lost; never the player's to order (see Behaviour); never inherited through `extends` |

Defaults when `extends` is absent: a unit is `domain: "ground"`, `tier: 1`, `pop: 1`, `speed: 60`, `turnRate: 3.5`, `vision: 8`, `radius: 9`, no `body` (units part on the circle of `radius`), armour by domain (ground and amphibious `medium`, ship `ship`, air `air`), a tread trail on land (`trail: "none"` for a unit on foot, which is then not heard rolling either) and a wake at sea; a building is `fw: 2, fh: 2`, `armor: "structure"`, `power: 0`, `pop: 0`. `buildTime` defaults to cost ÷ 14 seconds.
Where a unit is built when `producedBy` is absent: its domain's line from its tier up (ground: T1 → factory+factory2+factory3, T2 → factory2+factory3, T3 → factory3; ship: T1 → navyard+navyard2+navyard3, T2 → navyard2+navyard3, T3 → navyard3; air: T1 → airbase+airbase2+airbase3, T2 → airbase2+airbase3, T3 → airbase3; amphibious: T1 → factory+navyard+factory2+navyard2+factory3+navyard3, T2 → factory2+navyard2+factory3+navyard3, T3 → factory3+navyard3).
An `upgradeOf` def becomes upgrade-only (never placed directly): the named building gains an Upgrade button that turns it into this def, at `upgradeCost` over `upgradeTime`. A building may have only one next level, so `upgradeOf` can name a vanilla building at the end of its line (`power3`, `factory3`, `extractor3`, `gatling`, `cannonturret2`, `samsite`, `interceptor2`, `radar`, `repairtower`, `reactor`, `nukesilo`) or one of this mod's.

### A weapon (`defs[].weapons[]`)

| field | type | required | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string |  | w1, w2… | a name for the weapon |
| `cls` | mg \| autocannon \| cannon \| at \| he \| rocket \| navgun \| ashm \| torpedo \| aa | yes |  | what it was built to kill; picks its row of the armour matrix |
| `dmg` | number 0–100000 | yes |  | damage per hit |
| `reload` | number 0.05–600 | yes |  | seconds between shots or bursts |
| `range` | number 0.5–64 | yes |  | tiles |
| `minRange` | number 0–64 |  |  | tiles it cannot fire inside |
| `projectile` | bullet \| shell \| missile \| rocket \| bomb \| torpedo \| flak \| flame |  | by class | the round drawn |
| `speed` | number 1–5000 |  | by projectile | round speed, world px/s |
| `targets` | (ground \| ship \| sub \| air)[] |  | by class | what it may fire at: ground, ship, sub, air |
| `mult` | { armour: number } |  |  | overrides of the class row, by armour class |
| `splash` | number 0–500 |  |  | blast radius, world px |
| `burst` | integer 1–32 |  |  | shots per burst |
| `burstDelay` | number 0–5 |  |  | seconds between the shots of a burst |
| `homing` | boolean |  |  | the round tracks its target |
| `interceptable` | boolean |  |  | point defence may shoot it down |
| `arc` | boolean |  |  | a ballistic arc (artillery) |
| `turret` | boolean |  | true when the def has a turretSprite | fired from the rotating part |
| `vertical` | boolean |  |  | launched straight up out of the hull, like a submarine's missile tubes: it fires at any bearing and the hull never turns for it; `muzzleOffset` then runs along the keel to the tubes |
| `muzzleOffset` | number 0–200 |  |  | pivot to muzzle, world px; a unit's art is drawn 1.5625×, so measure on the sheet and multiply |
| `bores` | integer 1–8 |  | 1 | barrels, fired one after another |
| `boreSpacing` | number 0–60 |  |  | gap between adjacent barrels, world px |
| `spread` | number 0–200 |  |  | inaccuracy at full range, world px |
| `friendlyFire` | boolean |  |  | the blast hurts your own side too |
| `fan` | number 0–1.5 |  |  | a `flame` jet: the half-angle it is sprayed across, radians |
| `burn` | number 0–1000 |  |  | a `flame` jet: damage a second the fire it leaves does, to both sides |
| `burnLife` | number 0–120 |  |  | a `flame` jet: seconds that fire keeps burning |
| `sound` | string |  | by class | the firing sound: mg, autocannon, cannon, missile, flak, arty, rocket, torpedo, bomb, flame, or the key of one of this mod's `sounds` |
| `look` | look |  |  | how it looks, in place of its class: its own round, flash, burst where it lands, or a beam (see Weapon looks) |

The damage a weapon does is `dmg × the armour matrix cell for (cls, target armour)`, with `mult` overriding single cells. The matrix:

```
mg          light ×1.5  medium ×0.8  heavy ×0.4  structure ×0.35  ship ×0.5  air ×0.7
autocannon  light ×1.5  medium ×1  heavy ×0.5  structure ×0.5  ship ×0.7
cannon      light ×0.6  medium ×1.3  heavy ×1  structure ×0.8  ship ×0.9
at          light ×0.4  medium ×1.1  heavy ×1.8  structure ×0.7  ship ×0.75
he          light ×1.2  medium ×1  heavy ×0.75  structure ×1.6  ship ×1

### A decal (`defs[].decals[]`)

| field | type | required | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sprite` | string | yes |  | the sheet drawn: one of this mod's `dec.<name>` sheets, or any body or turret key |
| `on` | hull \| turret |  | hull | what it is fixed to and turns with; `turret` needs a `turretSprite` |
| `layer` | under \| hull \| over |  | hull, or over when on a turret | where it goes in the stack: under the body, on the hull under the turret, or over everything |
| `x` | number -256–256 |  | 0 | where it sits on the part's up-facing art: px right of the pivot, in the sheet's own px at its `fw`×`fh` size (the game scales it with the unit) |
| `y` | number -256–256 |  | 0 | px down from the pivot, toward the tail |
| `angle` | number -360–360 |  | 0 | turned this much further than what it is fixed to, degrees clockwise |
| `upright` | boolean |  |  | never turned: laid screen-up wherever its anchor is |
| `scale` | number 0.05–8 |  | 1 | drawn at this multiple of its sheet's size |
| `alpha` | number 0–1 |  | 1 | opacity |
| `when` | always \| moving \| still \| firing \| damaged \| night \| ability |  | always | shown only while the unit moves or stands (`moving`, `still`), within a reload of its last shot (`firing`), under half health (`damaged`), while its ability runs or is armed (`ability`), or after dusk (`night`: laid over the dark like a lamp, and the game's own headlights stay off a unit that has one) |

A decal is a picture laid on a def besides its body and its turret — a hatch, a crew figure, an outline, a lamp — fixed to the hull or the turret (`on`) and turned with it. Up to 12 on a def, drawn in the order listed within a layer. `x`/`y` are a point on that part's up-facing art: right and down (toward the tail) of its pivot, in the px of the sheet at its `fw`×`fh` size; the game scales them with the unit. The sheet is one of the mod's own under a `dec.<name>` key (see Art), or a body or turret key it borrows. A `night` decal is a lamp: laid over the dark rather than dimmed by it, so a headlight or a lit window reads as light, and a unit that carries one gets none of the game's own headlights. Paint a beam soft — a wide, faint falloff, not a hard-edged triangle — or it reads as glass.

### A turret mount (`defs[].turretMounts[]`)

| field | type | required | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `x` | number -256–256 |  | 0 | where the ring is on the body's up-facing art: px right of its pivot, in the body sheet's own px at its `fw`×`fh` size (the game scales it with the unit) |
| `y` | number -256–256 |  | 0 | px down from the pivot, toward the tail |
| `rest` | number -360–360 |  | 0 | the bearing it trains about, degrees clockwise from the bow: 0 forward, 90 to the right, 180 aft |
| `arc` | number 0–180 |  | 180 | how far either side of `rest` it turns, degrees; 180 is all round. A ring that cannot bear on the target waits at the end of its arc, and the rings that can take the shots |

A hull with more than one gun — a battleship's turrets fore and aft, a tank with a turret at each corner — names a ring for each, up to 8: the def's one `turretSprite` is drawn on every ring, and every ring is trained on the one target the unit is aiming at, as far round as its own `arc` of its `rest` bearing goes, so a gun the superstructure blocks waits at its stop while the others fire. A burst walks the rings that bear (the first shot from the first of them, the next from the next), and `muzzleOffset` is measured from the ring a shot leaves, so give a weapon of several guns a `burst` of that many. `x`/`y` are a point on the body's up-facing art, as a decal's are. A def with none has one ring, where its body sheet's `mount` puts it.

### A sheet (`sprites[]`)

| field | type | required | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `key` | string | yes |  | `u.<id>` for a body, `tur.<id>` for a rotating part, `dec.<name>` for a decal, `prj.<name>` for a round and `fx.<name>` for an effect a weapon's look or a rule plays; never a vanilla key |
| `file` | string | yes |  | the image, relative to mod.json (PNG, WebP or JPEG) |
| `frames` | integer 1–64 |  | 1 | animation frames, left to right in one strip |
| `fw` | number 4–512 |  | the footprint (a building) or the image | in-game frame width, whole world px |
| `fh` | number 4–512 |  |  | in-game frame height, whole world px |
| `rotated` | boolean |  |  | one up-facing image; the game bakes the 24 headings (hulls, turrets) |
| `pivotX` | number 0–1 |  | 0.5 | rotation pivot, as a fraction of the frame |
| `pivotY` | number 0–1 |  | 0.5 | rotation pivot, as a fraction of the frame |
| `anchorY` | number 0–512 |  |  | px from the top to the footprint centre (tall buildings) |
| `mount` | [x, y] |  |  | a body: where its turret sits (or, with a repair aura, where the beam leaves), as `[fx, fy]` |
| `fps` | number 0–60 |  |  | animation speed |
| `teams` | boolean |  | true | recolour magenta per faction; `false` draws the sheet as painted for every faction, and for the wreck |
| `ss` | integer 1–4 |  |  | supersample factor; omit to let the game choose |
| `fitFootprint` | boolean |  |  | scale the drawn content to fill the frame |
| `animRegion` | [x0, y0, x1, y1] |  |  | where the animation lives, `[x0, y0, x1, y1]` fractions; the rest is frozen |
| `stabilize` | boolean |  | true | re-align drifting frames |
| `freezeStatic` | boolean |  |  | median-freeze pixels that barely change |
| `stripBg` | boolean |  |  | force background removal on or off |
| `bgMinLuma` | number 0–255 |  |  | lightest colour still taken as background |
| `artifactCleanup` | boolean |  |  | sweep specks left by background removal |
| `anims` | { moving, idle, firing } |  |  | a unit body's frames by what it is doing, `{ moving, idle, firing }`, each `[first, last]` or `[first, last, fps]`: a tank that is a tree when it stands, a walker whose legs move only when it does (see Animation states) |

### A sound (`sounds[]`)

| field | type | required | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `key` | string | yes |  | `<mod id>-<name>`, lower case; what a weapon's `sound` names |
| `file` | string | yes |  | the recording, relative to mod.json. An MP3 plays everywhere; WAV works, OGG not on Safari. Dry, close, under a second |

A weapon fires with the game's sound for its class unless its `sound` names one of these keys. A recording is a dry, close-miked one-shot under a second with no reverb tail; the engine attenuates and pans it by distance, and forty overlapping echoes turn to mud. Mono MP3 is the safe format.

## Behaviour

A def may carry `rules`: things that happen to it — it turns into another of the mod's defs, spawns units, heals, pays, takes a buff, blows up — when something happens to it (`on`), when a condition comes true (`when`), on a clock (`every`), or when the player presses a button on its card (`button`). The words are a closed vocabulary, each one checked when the mod loads, so a rule can only do what the game already knows how to do safely; there is no scripting. Up to 24 rules a def. Rules are never inherited through `extends`, and the game's own units have none.

A tank that is a tree while it stands, and a tank again when it moves or fires — two defs, each turning into the other:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "mymod-mirage",
    "name": [
      "Mirage Tank",
      "幻影坦克"
    ],
    "extends": "mbt",
    "sprite": "u.mymod-mirage",
    "rules": [
      {
        "when": {
          "still": 1,
          "quiet": 0.8
        },
        "do": {
          "morph": "mymod-mirage-tree"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": "mymod-mirage-tree",
    "name": [
      "Mirage Tank",
      "幻影坦克"
    ],
    "extends": "mymod-mirage",
    "producedBy": [],
    "untargetable": true,
    "stealth": 3,
    "rules": [
      {
        "when": {
          "moving": true
        },
        "do": {
          "morph": "mymod-mirage"
        }
      },
      {
        "on": "fired",
        "do": {
          "morph": "mymod-mirage"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

A hero that ranks itself up from its card — the same unit, a new form, paid as the work is done:

```json
{
  "id": "mymod-hero",
  "name": [
    "Hero Tank",
    "英雄坦克"
  ],
  "extends": "mbt",
  "limit": 3,
  "rules": [
    {
      "button": {
        "cost": 600,
        "time": 20,
        "ai": true
      },
      "do": {
        "morph": "mymod-hero-gunner"
      }
    },
    {
      "button": {
        "cost": 900,
        "time": 30,
        "requires": [
          "radar"
        ]
      },
      "do": {
        "morph": "mymod-hero-sniper"
      }
    },
    {
      "every": 1,
      "if": {
        "hurtWithin": 0.5,
        "hpBelow": 0.3
      },
      "cooldown": 30,
      "do": [
        {
          "buff": {
            "taken": 0.5,
            "for": 5
          }
        },
        {
          "fx": "fx.repair"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### A rule (`defs[].rules[]`)

| field | type | required | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `on` | created \| destroyed \| fired \| damaged \| kill \| morphed |  |  | runs when this happens to it: made (`created`, and when a map stands it), killed (`destroyed`, where it fell), a shot fired (`fired`), hurt (`damaged`), a kill made (`kill`), or a change of form finished (`morphed`) |
| `when` | condition |  |  | runs when this condition becomes true, and again only after it has been false (see Conditions) |
| `every` | number 0.25–3600 |  |  | runs every so many seconds of its life |
| `button` | button |  |  | a button on its card the player presses (see Buttons) |
| `if` | condition |  |  | also checked when triggered: the rule runs only if this holds too; on a button, the button is greyed while it does not |
| `chance` | number 0–1 |  | 1 | the odds it runs when triggered |
| `cooldown` | number 0–3600 |  |  | seconds before it may run again |
| `max` | integer 1–1000 |  |  | times it may run on one unit, ever |
| `do` | effect \| effect[] | yes |  | what it does: an effect or a list of up to 8, in order (see Effects) |

Exactly one trigger. A `when` runs the moment its condition becomes true and not again until it has been false; one held back by its `if` or its `cooldown` tries again while the condition still holds. An `every` counts from the unit's making or its last change of form. Conditions are looked at ten times a second; events are answered on the tick they happen. A rule's `do` runs in order and stops at a change of form: what came after belonged to the old one.

### Conditions (`when`, `if`)

| field | type | required | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `moving` | boolean |  |  | is driving, flying or swimming (true) or standing (false) |
| `still` | number 0–3600 |  |  | has not moved for at least this many seconds |
| `firedWithin` | number 0–3600 |  |  | fired within the last so many seconds |
| `quiet` | number 0–3600 |  |  | has not fired for at least this many seconds |
| `hurtWithin` | number 0–3600 |  |  | was hurt within the last so many seconds |
| `hpBelow` | number 0–1 |  |  | health below this share of its whole |
| `hpAbove` | number 0–1 |  |  | health above this share of its whole |
| `age` | number 0–36000 |  |  | seconds since it was made, or last changed form |
| `flag` | string |  |  | a flag a rule has set on it is up |
| `noFlag` | string |  |  | that flag is down |
| `kills` | integer 0–10000 |  |  | it has made at least this many kills |
| `rank` | integer 1–3 |  |  | its veteran rank is at least this |
| `onWater` | boolean |  |  | stands on water (true) or on land (false) |
| `enemyWithin` | number 0.5–32 |  |  | an enemy its side can see is within this many tiles |
| `near` | { units, kind, side, within, count } |  |  | others stand near it: at least `count` of these `units` or this `kind`, on this `side`, `within` so many tiles (see Near) |
| `night` | boolean |  |  | it is night (true) or day (false) |
| `carrying` | integer 1–50 |  |  | has at least this many units in its hold |
| `killedBy` | id[] |  |  | on `destroyed`: what killed it was one of these defs (the dead rise only when the dead killed them) |
| `any` | condition |  |  | a list of conditions, one of which must hold |
| `not` | condition |  |  | a condition that must not hold |

Every key given must hold; `any` and `not` say otherwise. A misspelt condition is an error, not a condition that always holds.

### Near (`when.near`)

| field | type | required | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `units` | id[] |  |  | these defs only: the game's or any mod's |
| `kind` | unit \| building |  |  | only units, or only buildings |
| `side` | friend \| enemy \| any |  | any | whose: its own side and its allies (`friend`), an enemy's (only what its side can see), or anyone's |
| `within` | number 0.5–32 | yes |  | tiles from it to the other's edge |
| `count` | integer 1–50 |  | 1 | at least this many |

What stands near the unit, measured to the other's edge: a flyer that takes off only with something to hook onto (`{ "kind": "building", "within": 8 }`), troops that fight harder beside their commander (`{ "units": ["mymod-captain"], "side": "friend", "within": 10 }`), a wall that wakes when its master comes by. Name `units`, a `kind`, or both; an enemy is counted only when its side can see it.

### Effects (`do`)

| field | type | required | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `morph` | id |  |  | become another def of this mod, in place: the same unit (its selection, its kills and rank, the orders the new form can carry out), its health keeping its share of the whole. A building only takes the form of a building of the same footprint |
| `spawn` | { unit, count, side, into, max } |  |  | units put down beside it, or into its hold (see Spawn) |
| `heal` | number -1000000–1000000 |  |  | hit points given back; negative takes them, never the last one |
| `healPct` | number -1–1 |  |  | a share of its whole health given back |
| `metal` | number -99999–99999 |  |  | metal to its side; negative takes it, never below nothing |
| `flag` | string |  |  | raise a flag on it, for a condition to read |
| `unflag` | string |  |  | lower that flag |
| `buff` | { speed, damage, reload, taken, for } |  |  | multipliers held for `for` seconds: `speed`, the `damage` it deals, its `reload` time, and the harm it is `taken`; a new buff replaces the one it has |
| `explode` | { dmg, radius, cls, friendlyFire } |  |  | a blast round it: `dmg` at the centre falling to half at the edge of `radius` (world px), through the armour row of `cls` (default he); its own side is spared unless `friendlyFire` |
| `fx` | string |  |  | an effect played where it stands: one of this mod's `fx.<name>` sheets, or fx.expl.s, fx.expl.m, fx.expl.l, fx.spark, fx.flak, fx.smoke, fx.splash, fx.splash.l, fx.muzzle, fx.repair, fx.emp, fx.nuke |
| `fxScale` | number 0.05–8 |  | 1 | the effect drawn at this multiple |
| `sound` | string |  |  | a sound played where it stands: a weapon sound, expl, explBig, upgrade, or one of this mod's `sounds` |
| `die` | boolean |  |  | it is destroyed, as if killed by nobody (its own `destroyed` rules run) |
| `remove` | boolean |  |  | it is gone without a trace: no wreck, no loss, no `destroyed` |

### A spawn (`do.spawn`)

| field | type | required | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `unit` | id | yes |  | the unit: one of the game's or this mod's |
| `count` | integer 1–16 |  | 1 | how many |
| `side` | own \| killer |  | own | whose they are: its own side's, or (on `destroyed`) the side that killed it |
| `into` | hold |  |  | straight into its own hold, as far as the room goes, instead of beside it |
| `max` | integer 1–64 |  |  | at most this many of the units this rule has spawned alive at once |

A spawn never takes a side past its population cap or a def past its `limit`: it puts down what fits and no more. Spawned units are ordinary units of their side, standing where they were put down; a spawned unit's own `created` rules run too. `side: "killer"` on a `destroyed` rule is the dead rising for whoever killed them.

### A button (`rule.button`)

| field | type | required | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | text |  | the form it makes | the button's label |
| `desc` | text |  |  | its tooltip line |
| `cost` | number 0–99999 |  | 0 | metal, paid as the work is done |
| `time` | number 0–3600 |  | 0 | seconds of work at full power; 0 is at once |
| `requires` | id[] |  |  | buildings that must stand, or tech nodes researched, for it to be pressed (and to go on) |
| `ai` | boolean |  |  | a computer side presses it too, when it can spare the metal |

The button is a tile on the unit's card, pressed on every selected unit of that def free to take it. It starts on the production rule — three quarters of the price in hand — and is paid as the work is done; while it runs the tile wears its progress, and pressing it again stops it and gives back what it had cost. It waits while what it `requires` is down. A button whose `do` changes the unit's form is labelled with the form unless it has a `name`; any other button needs one.

### A change of form (`do.morph`)

The unit becomes another def of the same mod in place: the same unit, its side, where it stands and faces, its kills and veteran rank, its flags, the selection and the groups it is in; its health keeps its share of the whole, its guns carry on from where they were in their reload, and it keeps whatever orders the new form can carry out — a move, an attack. A unit turns only into a unit, and a building only into a building of the same footprint. The change is refused, and nothing happens, while the unit is being carried, while its hold holds more than the new form can, while its line or its magazine has work the new form cannot take over, or where the new form cannot stand (a boat on dry land). A form that nothing builds says `"producedBy": []`; the loader expects that of a form and says nothing.

### A weapon's look (`weapons[].look`)

| field | type | required | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sprite` | string |  |  | the round: one of this mod's `prj.<name>` sheets — its frames play as it flies, or, baked `rotated`, it is turned to its heading |
| `scale` | number 0.1–8 |  | 1 | the round and its flash drawn at this multiple |
| `beam` | { color, width, style, life } |  |  | the round is light: `{ color, width, style, life }` — a line from the muzzle to where it strikes, `laser` straight or `lightning` jagged, held `life` seconds; it strikes at once |
| `muzzle` | string |  | the class's flash | the muzzle flash: one of this mod's `fx.<name>` sheets, or `none` |
| `impact` | string |  | the class's burst | the burst where it lands: an `fx.<name>` sheet of this mod, one of fx.expl.s, fx.expl.m, fx.expl.l, fx.spark, fx.flak, fx.smoke, fx.splash, fx.splash.l, fx.muzzle, fx.repair, fx.emp, fx.nuke, or `none` |
| `impactScale` | number 0.1–8 |  | 1 | the burst drawn at this multiple |
| `impactLife` | number 0.05–5 |  | 0.5 | seconds the burst plays over |
| `trail` | smoke \| none |  | smoke | a rocket's or a missile's smoke trail, or none |

A look is only what is seen: the round hits as the weapon's numbers say. A beam is the exception by its nature — the round goes at once, so it lands where the beam is drawn. A round's sheet (`prj.<name>`) is small art facing up with `rotated: true`, or a strip of `frames` played as it flies; an effect's sheet (`fx.<name>`) is a strip played once, not rotated.

### A shield (`shield`)

| field | type | required | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hp` | number 1–1000000 | yes |  | what it takes before the hull does |
| `regen` | number 0–100000 |  | 0 | recharged a second |
| `delay` | number 0–600 |  | 3 | seconds unhurt before it starts to recharge |

The shield takes harm before the hull, its bar drawn over the health bar, and shimmers round the hull when struck. `regen` on the def (not the shield) is the hull mending itself.

### A carrier's wing (`wing`)

A unit may carry planes of the mod's own — a carrier's drones, a destroyer's one anti-submarine plane, an airship's swarm — that fly out at what it fights and come back to it:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "mymod-drone",
    "name": [
      "Strike Drone",
      "攻击无人机"
    ],
    "kind": "unit",
    "domain": "air",
    "cost": 60,
    "hp": 80,
    "pop": 0,
    "speed": 200,
    "producedBy": [],
    "weapons": [
      {
        "id": "gun",
        "cls": "mg",
        "dmg": 8,
        "reload": 0.5,
        "range": 2.5,
        "targets": [
          "ground",
          "ship"
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": "mymod-carrier",
    "name": [
      "Light Carrier",
      "轻型航母"
    ],
    "extends": "destroyer",
    "weapons": [],
    "wing": {
      "unit": "mymod-drone",
      "count": 8,
      "rebuild": 6,
      "sortie": 12,
      "rearm": 2,
      "range": 12
    }
  }
]
```

| field | type | required | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `unit` | id | yes |  | the plane: an aircraft of this mod with `"pop": 0` and `"producedBy": []`, made by its carrier alone |
| `count` | integer 1–16 |  | 1 | planes it keeps |
| `rebuild` | number 0.5–600 |  | 10 | seconds to make a lost one again, for nothing, one at a time |
| `sortie` | number 1–600 |  | 15 | seconds a plane stays out before it comes back to rearm |
| `rearm` | number 0–120 |  | 3 | seconds a plane back aboard waits before it flies again, mended as it waits |
| `range` | number 1–32 |  | 10 | tiles from the carrier its planes go out to fight |

The carrier comes with its planes aboard. While it has work — what its player sent it at, what its own guns are on, or else the nearest enemy its side can see within `range` that the planes can hit — a ready plane leaves the deck every third of a second. A plane comes back when the work is done, when it has been out `sortie` seconds, or when it is badly hurt, and waits `rearm` seconds aboard, mended as it waits, before it flies again; a lost one is made again every `rebuild` seconds, for nothing. A carrier with no guns of its own, sent at a target, closes to its wing's range and waits there. The planes are units of their side, with guns and kills of their own, but never the player's: they cannot be selected or ordered. A carrier lost takes the planes aboard with it; the ones out find another deck of their kind with room, or come down. The plane is an aircraft of the mod's own with `"pop": 0` and `"producedBy": []`: its carrier makes it, and nothing else does. A wing is never inherited through `extends`.

### Animation states (`sprites[].anims`)

| field | type | required | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `moving` | [first, last] or [first, last, fps] |  |  | `[first, last]` frames played while it moves, or `[first, last, fps]` |
| `idle` | [first, last] or [first, last, fps] |  | frame 0 | the frames while it stands |
| `firing` | [first, last] or [first, last, fps] |  |  | the frames within a reload of its last shot; before moving and idle |

On a unit's body sheet, the frames played by what it is doing instead of one loop: the `firing` range within a reload of its last shot, else the `moving` range while it moves, else `idle`. A sheet without `anims` rolls its frames while the unit moves and rests on the first, as treads do.

## Maps

A mod may carry maps: files the game's Scenario Editor exports (`.steel-tide-map`), named under `maps` in mod.json, up to 8 of them and each under 512 KB. While the mod is on, the Conquest setup and the lobby offer them as cards beside the player's own map; choosing one plays it exactly as painted. A map may stand the mod's own units and buildings before the whistle: with the mod on, they are in the editor's forces palette, and the map reads on any game that has the mod (the registry checks it against the mod's own defs, not the vanilla roster). A scene laid this way — a base built up, a horde at the gate — is how a mod shows what it is without a word.

## Units of measure

- A tile is 32 world pixels. `speed` and projectile `speed` are world px/s; `range`, `minRange`, `vision`, `sonar`, `stealth`, `detect`, `repairRange` and `interceptRange` are tiles; `radius`, `body.r`, `body.len`, `splash`, `spread`, `muzzleOffset` are world px.
- Times are seconds: `buildTime`, `reload`, `burstDelay`, `upgradeTime`, `interceptReload`, `nukeTime`.
- For scale: the Bison main battle tank is cost 280, hp 620, speed 60, radius 10, body `{ r: 13, len: 12 }`, a cannon of dmg 60 every 1.8 s at range 4.6; a scout car is cost 60, hp 150, speed 120; a war factory is 3×3 tiles, hp 1500, power −8.

## Art

- Keys: a def's body is `u.<id>`, a rotating turret `tur.<id>`. A def with no sheet of its own may borrow vanilla art by naming a vanilla key in `sprite` (e.g. `"sprite": "u.mbt", "turretSprite": "tur.mbt"`); with `extends` it inherits the base's art. A mod may not replace vanilla art.
- A sheet is one PNG (WebP and JPEG are accepted): `frames` animation frames left to right in one horizontal strip, evenly spaced, no gaps, no borders.
- Hulls, turrets and everything that turns: draw ONE image facing UP and set `"rotated": true`; the game bakes the 24 headings. `fw`/`fh` are the in-game size of that up-facing image in world px (a tank hull is about 24×24; the image itself may be any resolution, 2–4× is best). `pivotX`/`pivotY` put the pivot on the turret ring (default centre).
- Buildings: one strip of frames, not rotated, drawn with a slight top-down southern tilt. The footprint is the bottom `fw×32` by `fh×32` px of the frame; anything above overhangs the terrain behind (towers, masts). Width, height and anchor are sized from the def's footprint automatically.
- A building with a gun that turns is two sheets like a hull and turret: the body with an empty ring and `"mount": [fx, fy]` saying where the ring sits as fractions of the frame, and a `tur.<id>` sheet for the gun; its weapons carry `"turret": true`.
- Several guns of one kind on one hull are one `tur.<id>` sheet and a `turretMounts` ring for each, not guns painted on the body: a painted gun never turns.
- A decal's sheet (`dec.<name>`) is drawn like a turret's: one up-facing image, or a strip of `frames` at `fps` for something that moves (a spinning barrel, a blinking light), sized by `fw`/`fh` and drawn about its centre. Static detail belongs in the body's own sheet; a decal is for what the body cannot hold — a part that turns with the turret, a hatch the barrel sweeps over, a light that comes on at night, a barrel that spins while it fires.
- Faction colour: paint team-coloured parts in pure magenta (highlight #FF66FF, base #FF00FF, shadow #990099) and use magenta nowhere else; the game recolours it per player.
- Style: crisp pixel art, hard edges, no anti-aliasing, a muted military palette (DawnBringer-32), dark #222034 outlines. Generated sheets are cleaned automatically (background removal, frame registration), but a transparent background is best.

## Test

1. Validate: in a clone of the registry, `node tools/check.mjs path/to/my-mod` prints every error with its path into mod.json. (No clone? The game says the same things when the mod is loaded.)
2. Load it in the game: Settings → Mods → *Open folder…* (Chrome keeps the folder open, so *Reload* re-reads your edits) or *Upload file…* (a zip of the folder, or a `.steel-tide-mod` file). Errors are listed on the spot; a loaded mod says how many units and buildings it added.
3. Play: start a Conquest match. Your units are in the factory's production list from the level you gave them; buildings are in the engineer's build menu; an upgrade level is on its building's Upgrade button. The console (backquote) has `give <id>` for anything. Mods apply to Conquest and the campaign; a networked match is always unmodded.
4. From a static server: `npx serve --cors path/to/my-mod` then open `https://play.steelti.de/?mod=http://localhost:3000/` — the mod is fetched at every boot, so a page reload picks up an edit.

## Publish

1. Fork https://github.com/steel-tide/mods, add your folder as `mods/<id>/` (the folder name is the mod's `id`), run `node tools/check.mjs mods/<id>`, open a pull request.
2. A published mod carries at least one screenshot of it in play, named under `screenshots` in mod.json: 4:3 (1600×1200 is a good size), at least 640 px wide, PNG, JPEG or WebP under 2 MB, up to 8 of them. The game's Settings → Mods page and https://steelti.de/mods show them; the first is the mod's card. Take them in a match with the mod's units on screen (the console's `give` puts them there) and crop to 4:3.
3. CI runs the same check on the whole registry: ids must be unique across every published mod, so prefix a generic word with your mod's id (`ironworks-bunker`, not `bunker`).
4. Once merged, the index is rebuilt and the mod appears in the game's registry list and at https://steelti.de/mods, where its installs are counted. Bump `version` for every change; the game offers the update.

## Rules

- A mod adds; it does not change vanilla defs, art, rules or interface. Do not try to override a vanilla id or key; the validator refuses it.
- Keep it honest: a unit needs a counter. The armour matrix is how the game makes one; give a new weapon a class it belongs to rather than an override on every cell.
- A mod is published under the licence its manifest names (default CC-BY-4.0). Only ship art you have the right to.
